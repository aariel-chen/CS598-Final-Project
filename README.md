# CS 598 Deep Learning for Healthcare Final Project

This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning model that predicts anticancer drug synergy for understudied tissues using transfer learning techniques. The goal is to leverage data from well-studied contexts to improve predictions in contexts where data is scarce.
